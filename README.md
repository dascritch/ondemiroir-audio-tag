Purpose
-------

This is an hashtag extention for `<audio>`, derivated from timecodehash.js
It could have been done via HTML templates, with a polyfill like the excellent Bosonic, but I wanted a plain vanilla, easy to install and configure.

It will replace any <audio control> by an specialy crafted UI

Todo
----

- Building HTML element
- Support for lazy load CSS
- Support for elapsed time / countdown time / total time
- Support for time anchor derivated from Tiemcode Hash
- Support for title via title=""
- Support for cover via poster=""
- Support for canonical url via canonical=""
- Support for mute/ volume
- Support for time line
- Support for gear menu
- Support for download / sharing twitter / facebook
